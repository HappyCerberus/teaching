Scheduling the GRID(s)

National and international distributed computing (and storage) infrastructures
consist of individual sites that keep their autonomy and authoritative
decisions over the use of provided resources. Coordinated use of such resources
needs a proper scheduling policy and mechanisms to enforce it. With the
continuous growth of the infrastructure, a centralised scheduling is
practically impossible to enforce. More distributed mechanisms (and policies)
are needed to fulfil both the growth and autonomy requirements. As sites are
not necessarily hierarchically organised, some kind of peer to peer
collaborative model will be the first target. Such distributed model has a
potential for higher stability and scalability while being capable to guarantee
the (partial) autonomy required by different sites.

In this introductory talk you will be introduced to the challenges of job
scheduling in GRID environment. Particular attention will be given to the
challenges of scheduling in a distributed environment, where each party requires
significant autonomy.
